## What Did We Do?
Renewable energy generation changes are unpredictable, and are dangerous to the energy grid. In practice, we accomodate for these rapid changes in renewable energy through dispatachable energy generation, the vast majority of which is hydroelectric and natural gas. A major way to combat the supply/demand mismatch at the day is to adjust the price of energy in real-time energy markets. Two major focuses of increasing battery utilization in grids are first decreasing the price (or increasing the effectiveness) of the physical battery and second to more intelligently integrate these batteries into the grid. Our solution explores the second possibility, through reinforcement learning we should be able to redirect energy back to the grid irrespective of the size of the batteries.
